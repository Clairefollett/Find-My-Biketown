// Access the validated user’s address object from the input form

// Call the Biketown API to grab station info, specifically lat/long coordinates. Other possibilities: name, number of bikes available.
// And possibly store it, an array of objects, in local storage?

// Create a function to calculate the distance between the user’s address and each Biketown station
// The function takes user’s address as one argument and an array of objects with the bike station coordinates as the second argument

// Copy the bike station array of objects with .map()? and add a distance property

// Use the distance formula d=√​(x​2​​−x​1​​)​2​​+(y​2​​−y​1​​)​2​​​​​ to give each distance property a value

// .sort(compare(a,b) the mapped? array by the distance property, ascending order

// Return the array of objects

// Append the returned array of objects from the distance function (up to a determined amount i.e. 5 indexes) as a list to the view/HTML
